                    +------------+                 +------------+
                    |  Category  |                 |  Subcategory|
                    +------------+                 +------------+
                          |                              |
                          |                              |
                          v                              v

```

This ER diagram illustrates the relationships between the entities. Each product can be associated with one or more categories and subcategories. Additionally, a product can have stock information, multiple images, and reviews.


### UseCases

Here are several use cases that can be implemented based on the provided requirements:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to the product catalog system. Different user roles (e.g., admin, customer) can have different permissions, such as adding/editing products, managing categories, or viewing product details.

2. **Order Management**:
   - Allow users to place orders for products listed in the catalog. Implement features such as adding products to a shopping cart, checkout process, order tracking, and order history.

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Extend the stock management functionality to include inventory management features. Track the quantity of each product available in stock, receive notifications for low stock levels, and manage inventory replenishment processes.

4. **Product Recommendations**:
   - Implement recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase history, or similar products. This can improve user engagement and increase sales by promoting personalized product recommendations.

5. **Product Reviews and Ratings**:
   - Enhance the review functionality to allow users to rate products and provide detailed reviews. Implement features such as sorting products based on ratings, displaying average ratings for products, and allowing users to filter products based on ratings.

6. **Advanced Filtering and Search**:
   - Enhance the filtering and search functionality to support advanced filtering options and faceted search. Allow users to filter products based on multiple criteria simultaneously, such as price range, brand, size, color, and other attributes.

7. **Promotions and Discounts**:
   - Implement promotional campaigns and discount codes to incentivize purchases. Allow users to apply discount codes during checkout and display promotional banners or offers on the product pages.

By implementing these additional use cases, the product catalog system can become more comprehensive, engaging, and valuable for both the business and its users.


### API Endpoints

Here's a basic outline of the API endpoints for each use case:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - POST /api/auth/login: Endpoint for user authentication. Accepts username/email and password, returns authentication token.
   - POST /api/auth/logout: Endpoint to invalidate user authentication token and log out.

2. **Order Management**:
   - POST /api/orders: Endpoint to create a new order. Requires authentication token. Accepts order details (e.g., product IDs, quantities).
   - GET /api/orders/{orderId}: Endpoint to retrieve details of a specific order. Requires authentication token and authorization (user should be able to view their own orders).
   - GET /api/orders: Endpoint to retrieve a list of orders. Requires authentication token and authorization.

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - GET /api/inventory/products: Endpoint to retrieve a list of products in inventory. Requires authentication token and authorization (e.g., admin role).
   - POST /api/inventory/products: Endpoint to add a new product to inventory. Requires authentication token and authorization (e.g., admin role).
   - PUT /api/inventory/products/{productId}: Endpoint to update product details in inventory. Requires authentication token and authorization (e.g., admin role).
   - DELETE /api/inventory/products/{productId}: Endpoint to delete a product from inventory. Requires authentication token and authorization (e.g., admin role).

4. **Product Recommendations**:
   - GET /api/products/recommendations: Endpoint to fetch recommended products for the authenticated user based on their browsing/purchase history.

5. **Product Reviews and Ratings**:
   - POST /api/products/{productId}/reviews: Endpoint to submit a review for a specific product. Requires authentication token.
   - GET /api/products/{productId}/reviews: Endpoint to retrieve reviews for a specific product.

6. **Advanced Filtering and Search**:
   - GET /api/products: Endpoint to retrieve a list of products with filtering and search parameters (e.g., category, price range, keyword search).
   - GET /api/categories: Endpoint to retrieve a list of categories.
   - GET /api/products/{productId}: Endpoint to retrieve details of a specific product.

7. **Promotions and Discounts**:
   - POST /api/promotions/discounts: Endpoint to apply a discount code during checkout. Requires authentication token.
   - GET /api/promotions/banners: Endpoint to retrieve promotional banners or offers for the product pages.


### Concurrency and Parallelism 

1. **/api/orders**: Message queues and background workers to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
2. **/api/inventory/products**: To optimize concurrency, you can use techniques such as caching to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
3. **/api/products/recommendations**: Parallelization techniques such as distributed computing frameworks or batch processing to analyze user behavior data and generate recommendations in parallel across multiple nodes or processing units.
4. **/api/products**: To handle concurrency effectively, consider using efficient indexing and query optimization techniques in the underlying database to ensure fast response times for complex queries.
