   - Ensure session persistence and handling of session timeouts.

3. **Real-time Messaging**:
   - Enable real-time communication between users.
   - Support text messaging, file sharing, and multimedia messaging.

4. **Asynchronous Messaging**:
   - Allow users to send messages asynchronously.
   - Ensure message delivery even if the recipient is offline.

5. **Group Chat**:
   - Enable users to create and participate in group conversations.
   - Allow adding or removing participants dynamically.

6. **Notification System**:
   - Notify users about new messages, group invites, or other relevant events.
   - Support push notifications for mobile devices and desktop notifications for web clients.

7. **Message History**:
   - Store message history for users to view past conversations.
   - Implement message archiving and retrieval functionalities.

8. **Security**:
   - Ensure end-to-end encryption for message transmission.
   - Implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to messages.

## Entities:

1. **User**:
   - Attributes: UserID, Username, Password, Email, Role
   - Relationships: None

2. **Session**:
   - Attributes: SessionID, UserID, StartTime, LastActivityTime
   - Relationships: One-to-One with User

3. **Message**:
   - Attributes: MessageID, SenderID, ReceiverID, GroupID, Content, Timestamp
   - Relationships: Many-to-One with User (Sender), Many-to-One with User (Receiver), Many-to-One with Group

4. **Group**:
   - Attributes: GroupID, Name, CreatorID, CreationTime
   - Relationships: One-to-Many with User (Participants)

## Components and Responsibilities:

1. **User Management Component**:
   - Responsible for user authentication, registration, and role-based access control.

2. **Session Management Component**:
   - Manages user sessions, including creation, validation, and expiration.
   - Tracks user activity to maintain session freshness.

3. **Messaging Component**:
   - Handles message transmission, reception, and storage.
   - Ensures real-time or asynchronous delivery of messages.
   - Provides functionalities for group chats and one-to-one conversations.

4. **Notification Component**:
   - Generates and dispatches notifications for new messages, group invites, or other events.
   - Supports various notification channels such as email, push notifications, or desktop alerts.

## API Endpoints:

1. **User Management**:
   - `/api/auth/login` (POST): User login.
   - `/api/auth/logout` (POST): User logout.
   - `/api/auth/register` (POST): User registration.
   - `/api/users/{userID}` (GET, PUT, DELETE): User profile management.

2. **Session Management**:
   - No specific API endpoints needed as session management is handled internally.

3. **Messaging**:
   - `/api/messages/send` (POST): Send a message.
   - `/api/messages/{userID}/history` (GET): Get message history with a specific user.
   - `/api/messages/{groupID}/history` (GET): Get message history for a group chat.

4. **Group Management**:
   - `/api/groups/create` (POST): Create a new group chat.
   - `/api/groups/{groupID}` (GET, PUT, DELETE): Get, update, or delete group information.
   - `/api/groups/{groupID}/addMember` (POST): Add a member to a group.
   - `/api/groups/{groupID}/removeMember` (POST): Remove a member from a group.

5. **Notification**:
   - `/api/notifications` (GET): Get notifications for the current user.
   - `/api/notifications/{notificationID}/markAsRead` (POST): Mark a notification as read.

## Concurrency and Parallelism Scope:

1. **Session Management**:
   - Handle concurrent session creation, validation, and expiration using asynchronous task scheduling or worker pools.
   
2. **Messaging Component**:
   - Implement message transmission and reception asynchronously to handle concurrent message exchanges.
   - Utilize message queues or event-driven architectures for real-time messaging.

3. **Notification Component**:
   - Send notifications asynchronously to avoid blocking user interactions.
   - Use distributed systems for scalable notification delivery across multiple channels.

## Coding Practices for Concurrency:

- Utilize asynchronous programming paradigms such as async/await (in languages like Python or JavaScript) or goroutines (in Go) to handle concurrent operations efficiently.
- Implement thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms to prevent data races and ensure data consistency in concurrent environments.
- Use connection pooling and resource optimization techniques to manage concurrent database access.
- Employ distributed caching solutions to improve performance and reduce latency in high-concurrency scenarios.
- Implement retry and error-handling strategies to handle transient failures and maintain system reliability in asynchronous operations.
