# Feed Management System

## Functional Requirements:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Users should authenticate to access their feeds.
   - Different user roles (e.g., regular users, administrators) with appropriate permissions should be supported.

2. **Session Management**:
   - User sessions should be maintained to track active users and their interactions with the feed system.

3. **Feed Operations**:
   - Users should be able to create posts with text, images, or videos.
   - Users should be able to like and comment on posts.
   - Users should be able to follow other users to see their posts in their feed.
   - The system should prioritize displaying relevant content based on user preferences and interactions.

## Entities:

Based on the requirements, we can identify the following entities:

1. **User**:
   - Attributes: UserID, Username, Password, Email, Role
   - Relationships:
     - One user can have multiple posts, comments, likes, and followers (1-to-many).
     - Users can follow multiple other users (many-to-many).

2. **Post**:
   - Attributes: PostID, UserID, Content, MediaURLs, Timestamp
   - Relationships:
     - One post belongs to one user (many-to-one).
     - One post can have multiple comments and likes (1-to-many).

3. **Comment**:
   - Attributes: CommentID, PostID, UserID, Content, Timestamp
   - Relationships:
     - One comment belongs to one post (many-to-one).
     - One comment is made by one user (many-to-one).

4. **Like**:
   - Attributes: LikeID, PostID, UserID, Timestamp
   - Relationships:
     - One like belongs to one post (many-to-one).
     - One like is made by one user (many-to-one).

5. **Follow**:
   - Attributes: FollowerID, FolloweeID
   - Relationships:
     - One follow action is performed by one follower and targets one followee (many-to-many).

## Use Cases:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user feeds. Use tokens or session-based authentication.

2. **Posting Content**:
   - Allow users to create posts with text, images, or videos. Store post content along with the user who created it and the timestamp.

3. **Interacting with Posts**:
   - Users should be able to like and comment on posts. Store likes and comments associated with the respective posts and users.

4. **Following Users**:
   - Users should be able to follow other users to see their posts in their feed. Implement a follow mechanism to establish relationships between users.

5. **Displaying Relevant Content**:
   - Prioritize displaying relevant content in the user's feed based on their interactions, preferences, and followings. Use algorithms to determine content relevance.

## API Endpoints:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - `/api/auth/login` (POST)
   - `/api/auth/logout` (POST)
   - `/api/auth/register` (POST)
   - `/api/users/{userID}` (GET, PUT, DELETE)

2. **Feed Operations**:
   - `/api/posts` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/posts/{postID}` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - `/api/posts/{postID}/comments` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/posts/{postID}/likes` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/users/{userID}/follow` (POST)

## Concurrency and Parallelism:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Handle authentication requests concurrently using goroutines, ensuring secure session management and token validation.

2. **Feed Operations**:
   - Implement concurrent handling of feed-related operations like fetching posts, adding comments, and processing likes to improve system responsiveness.

3. **Content Recommendation**:
   - Utilize parallel processing techniques to analyze user preferences and interactions, generating relevant content recommendations for the feed.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Ensure concurrent access to the database for storing and retrieving feed-related data, optimizing database queries and transactions for scalability and performance.

5. **Feed Rendering**:
   - Parallelize the process of rendering the user's feed based on relevant content, optimizing content fetching and rendering for a seamless user experience.
