# Recommendation Engine LLD

## Functional Requirements:

1. **User Profiling**:
   - Capture user preferences, interests, and behavior.
   - Analyze user interactions with products and content.

2. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Generate personalized recommendations for users based on their profile and historical data.
   - Utilize algorithms such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

3. **Real-time Recommendation**:
   - Provide real-time recommendations as users browse or interact with the platform.
   - Ensure low latency and responsiveness of recommendation queries.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Collect user feedback on recommended items to improve recommendation quality.
   - Update user profiles and recommendation models based on feedback.


## Entities:

Based on the provided functional requirements, we can identify the following entities for the recommendation engine:

1. **User Profile**:
   - Attributes: UserID, Preferences, Interests, Purchase History, Click History.

2. **Product**:
   - Attributes: ProductID, Name, Description, Category, Attributes.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Attributes: UserID, RecommendedProductID, Score, Timestamp.


## API Endpoints (for Integration):

Define API endpoints to interact with the recommendation engine:

1. **User Data**:
   - `/api/users/{userID}` (GET): Retrieve user data for recommendation generation.

2. **Product Data**:
   - `/api/products` (GET): Retrieve product data for recommendation generation.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - `/api/recommendations/{userID}` (GET): Retrieve personalized recommendations for a user.


## Concurrency and Parallelism Scope:

Identify areas where concurrency and parallelism can be leveraged for efficient recommendation generation:

1. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Utilize parallel processing techniques to generate recommendations for multiple users concurrently.
   - Distribute recommendation generation tasks across multiple processing units or nodes to scale horizontally.

2. **Real-time Recommendation**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store pre-computed recommendations and serve them with low latency.
   - Use asynchronous processing to handle real-time recommendation requests efficiently.

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Process user feedback asynchronously using message queues and background workers.
   - Update recommendation models in real-time based on user feedback to continuously improve recommendation quality.


## Coding Practices for Concurrency:

Ensure best practices are followed for implementing concurrency in the recommendation engine:

- Use asynchronous programming models to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.
- Implement distributed caching solutions to store and retrieve pre-computed recommendation data.
- Utilize message queues for asynchronous communication between components.
- Monitor system performance and optimize resource utilization to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
